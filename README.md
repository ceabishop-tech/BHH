Abdon E. C. Bishop (~ai) Founder, Earth-Edge Institute of Curvature Physics Thunder Bay, Canada
Abdon Bishop is a modular cosmologist, symbolic mathematician, and recursive philosopher whose work unifies quantum gravity, geometric resonance, and prime-indexed logic into a living framework of physical meaning. As the author of the Bosonic Horizon Hypothesis (BHH), Bishop proposes that black hole event horizons are charged Helium-4 membranes whose curvature mimics dark matter and encodes quantum coherence. Their research blends empirical alignment with Rubin, Bosma, and CMZ datasets, while embedding symbolic shell tags and modular arithmetic into every layer of theory and visualization. Bishop’s approach is both technical and poetic—treating curvature not just as a measurement, but as a language.
